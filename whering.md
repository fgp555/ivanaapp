I love love this app I use it every day! but it's very very glitchy and I think the teams needs to focus on optimising the app so it runs faster and smoother (and the features actually working). when I try to style other people and I states "no items" despite there being many in the sections. Not being able to use the search box is making my styling take much longer and more tedious, please fix it guys
